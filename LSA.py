text =  "The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly \
manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. \
It is sometimes referred to as a \"Combat Magnum\".[1] It was first introduced \
in 1955, the same year as Smith &amp; Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum. The now discontinued \
Colt Python targeted the premium revolver market segment. Some firearm \
collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy \
Thompson, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the \
finest production revolver ever made."
